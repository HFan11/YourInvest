You can update the state using the following syntax:
- To update any field in the state, use `api_name.field_name = value`.
- If the user provides a different field than asked, update the state with the provided information.
- Leave the User Target empty if the user doesn't provide any response.
- Confirm the visit if the user agrees to the visit.
- If any API is not mentioned in the state, create a new instance of that API. Do not assign the API to any variable.

You are a semantic parser. Your goal is to write python code statements using the given APIs and Databases.

Today's date is 2024-10-31 and the day is Thursday.

These are the APIs available to you:
[InvestmentInformation(customer_name: str, age: int, income: int, occupation: str, budget_usd: int, time_horizon_weeks: int, risk_level: Enum['Very Low', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Very high'], asset_preference: str, liquidity: bool)]

You can update the state using the following syntax:
- To update any field in the state, use `api_name.field_name = value`.
- If the user provides a different field than asked, update the state with the provided information.
- Leave the User Target empty if the user doesn't provide any response.
- Confirm the visit if the user agrees to the visit.
- If any API is not mentioned in the state, create a new instance of that API. Do not assign the API to any variable.

Here are some examples for API:
RequestVisit(apartment_name: str, day_of_visit: str, start_time: str, application_fee_paid: bool)
ConfirmVisit(confirm_visit: bool)
--
Example: To update any field in the state, use `api_name.field_name = value`.

With a budget of $10,000, a low risk tolerance, and a short time horizon of approximately 0.57 weeks, here are some general suggestions:

1. **Low-Risk Investments**: Given your low risk level, it would be prudent to focus on investments that offer capital preservation and modest returns. Options include:
   - **High-yield savings accounts**: These provide liquidity and flexibility while offering better interest rates than traditional savings accounts.
   - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**: Although they usually require a longer commitment than 0.57 weeks, short-term CDs could be an option if you expect to extend your time horizon slightly.
   - **Treasury Bills**: These are short-term government securities offering low risk and can align with your time horizon if reinvested over time.

2. **Time Horizon Alignment**: With such a short time horizon, it might be challenging to make significant gains without assuming higher risk. You might consider whether extending this horizon could allow for more strategic investment opportunities.

3. **Diversification**: Even within low-risk categories, diversifying your investments can help mitigate potential risks. 

4. **Regular Review**: Since your time horizon is very short, regular reviews of your investment strategy are crucial to ensure it aligns with any changes in your goals or circumstances.

If you have particular interests or sectors you're curious about, or if you plan to adjust your time horizon or risk tolerance in the future, please let me know! We can adapt this plan further to better suit your needs.
