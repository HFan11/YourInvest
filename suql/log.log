Chatbot: Based on your high-risk tolerance and budget of $50,000 for a 1-month investment horizon, I recommend the following portfolio allocation:

| Ticker   | Allocation (%) | Investment ($) | Return (%) | Volatility |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| VERB.US  | 60%            | $30,000        | 21413.29%  | 35.26      |
| XPON.US  | 40%            | $20,000        | 8162.71%   | 21.24      |

Portfolio Summary:
- Weighted Return: 14788.00%
- Weighted Volatility: 28.25

These selections offer high potential returns but come with significant volatility. It's important to monitor these investments closely due to their high-risk nature.

Would you like to proceed with this portfolio allocation?
User: i want to increase the number of tickers to 4
[Database returns "[]"]
Chatbot: I didn't find any specific results for a portfolio with four tickers that match your criteria. Since you want to increase the number of tickers to 4, we can explore additional high-risk, high-return stocks to diversify your portfolio further. Would you like me to suggest more options or adjust the allocation of the existing stocks to accommodate four tickers?
User: sure, you can refine my request by add 1 more etf
[Database returns "[]"]
Chatbot: I couldn't find any specific results for adding one more ETF to your portfolio. To refine your request and include an additional ETF, I can suggest another high-risk, high-return stock to further diversify your investments. Would you like me to provide you with another option to enhance your portfolio?
User: Can we include more high-return options, even if they have medium risk?
[Database returns "[]"]
Chatbot: I searched for high-return options with medium risk, but I couldn't find any matching results in our database. Since you're interested in including more high-return options, even with medium risk, we may need to adjust the search criteria or explore different combinations of stocks and ETFs to meet your preferences. Would you like me to suggest alternative options or refine the search further to find suitable investments for your portfolio?
